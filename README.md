# Deep-Learning-Approach-for-PLS-in-Gaussian-Multiple-Access-Wiretap-Channel-

Simulations for the paper "Deep Learning Approach for PLS in Gaussian Multiple Access Wiretap Channel" 

* The code needs a package for K-Means equal cluster-size. For that, I am using the code from https://github.com/ndanielsen/Same-Size-K-Means 

* Find discussion document [here](/Codes for Discussion/Discussion.pdf)
